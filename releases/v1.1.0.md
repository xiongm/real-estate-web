# Release v1.1.0 – 2024-05-27

This release bundles everything added since **v1.0.3**, focusing on better designer ergonomics, faithful signer rendering, and clearer CTAs/spinners for admins.

## Highlights

- **Canvas fidelity:** PDF padding fixes and updated coordinate math ensure text/date inputs appear exactly where they were placed, both during signing and in the sealed PDF.
- **Font-aware text fields:** Designers pick from Sans, Serif, Times New Roman, Mono, or Script; the choice is shown on-canvas, honored on the signer surface, and embedded into the final packet.
- **Consistent field affordances:** Signature, text, and date boxes display the same icons as their toolbar buttons, while checkbox fields keep a compact ✕ box with a tooltip label.
- **Polished UX:** Request-sign and admin pages gained refreshed buttons (e.g., “Request Signatures”), better hover states, inline loading indicators during admin-token verification, and improved back-navigation that preserves the active project.
- **Mobile safeguards:** Request-sign now warns mobile users to switch to desktop, while admin received responsive layout improvements and lightweight menus.

## Detailed Changes

### Designer / Request-Sign
- Added inline field tooltips and font badges, plus the option to select Times New Roman.
- Drag handles and delete controls were repositioned so tooltips and badges never overlap.
- PDF cards were restructured (padding removed from the absolute overlay layer) to keep coordinates consistent between design and signing.
- Investor tool buttons received new icons, hover shadows, and clearer labeling.

### Signing Experience
- Text and date fields now use `box-sizing: border-box` and updated positioning math, eliminating the downward drift seen in v1.0.3.
- Signature canvas improvements (thicker strokes, better mobile clear button) make drawing easier on touch devices.
- Completion pages show a sticky status panel so signers immediately see SHA / sealing status.

### Admin & Workflow
- “Request Signatures” CTA restyled (flat button + descriptive subtitle) and moved per user feedback.
- Admin-token prompts now show immediate spinners during verification.
- Mobile layout refinements introduce hidden menus for projects/investors without altering the desktop design.

No database schema changes were introduced between v1.0.3 and v1.1.0, so deploys only need a standard `docker compose up -d --build`.
